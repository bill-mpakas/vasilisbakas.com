#### The Challenge 
A successful theme is being used by many businesses and professional web builders, in different countries with different languages.

It also has sections that can be re-arranged, adjusted and branded while it still looks awesome. At the same time, it needs to "feel" special and somehow differentiate from the rest of the market and from the rest of your themes.
